### C# Basics and .NET

1. What is compile time and runtime?

* Compile time is the period when the programming code is converted to the machine code.

* Runtime is the period of time when a programming is running and generally occurs after compile time.

2. What is .NET?

* .NET is an open source platform for building desktop, web, and mobile application that can run natively on any operating system.

3. What is the difference between framework, core and 5/6/7?

* .NET framework runs on windows

* .NET core runs on windows, linux and macOS

* .NET 7 is the latest version of .NET core

4. What is a conditional breakpoint?

* You can specify, which information from your program (values of variables etc.) shall be transmitted to Visual Micro when the breakpoint is hit.

5. What is the difference between compiling to debug and release formats?

* Debug includes debug information in the compiled files (allowing easy debugging) while Release usually has optimizations enabled.

### Refactorin, Unit Tests

1. What does the using keyword do?

* creates an alias for a namespace or imports types defined in other namespaces

2. What is refactoring?

* change the code structure without changing or affecting what the code itself actually does

3. Why did we need to refactor the code in main method?

* so that the code can be reusable

4. What is unit testing?

* The process of checking small pieces of code to deliver information

5. Why should we write unit tests?

* So that developers can have more control over their individual code block quality before integrating different components and then sent for regression testing
